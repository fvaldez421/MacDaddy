## About

This is a project built as a means to track a user's Macronutrient intake and caloric goals. 

When completed, the application should give a user the ability to log their meals daily and use the provided calendar to view and edit their meals and meal statistics from previous days.

Entered meals will have Fats, Carbs and Protein entered in grams. These values will be rendered and used to generate a "Calorie Total" for the day. This Calorie Total will be compared against the users goal Caloric Intake and their Set Maintenance Caloric Intake.
